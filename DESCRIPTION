Description: Provides custom implementations of existing statistical genetics estimators, designed to work on extremely large files and handle missing data.  Includes the Standard Kinship estimator (mean-of-ratios and ratio-of-means versions), and the Weir-Cockerham, Weir-Hill, Hudson pairwise, and Generalized "Hudson" FST estimators.  Also calculates the limits of several biased kinship estimators.
